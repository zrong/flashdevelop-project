FlashDevelop Project
======

## Introduction

As a linuxer, I hate the Widows/DOS Batch file(.bat), but it uses a lot of .bat file in the official FlashDevelop project templates. I can use them, or delete them and write some new project projects in another scripting language.

I wrote some project templates in [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). Some are instead of the official projects, some offer a function that isn't in official projects like SWC Generator.
